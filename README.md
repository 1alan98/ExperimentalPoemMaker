# ExperimentalPoemMaker

I made this program for experimental poetry class. I was assigned to make an experimental poem using any method I could
think of, so I decided to write a program that would do it for me. 

Basically, ExperimentalPoemMaker is able to extract the words found in a given piece of text. The extracted words are then
pieced together at random to make a poem. The last words of the 3rd, 4th, 7th, and 8th stanza are not truly random since
the program searches for words that rhyme (if no rhyming words are found then the program decides its ok for the word not to 
rhyme in this case). Most of the poems that ExperimentalPoem maker creates don't make sense, but it is fun to try to make
sense out of them. Humans make progress when we try to make sense of that we don't understand and that's something I tried 
to capture while making this progam. I hope you enjoy!

Quick note: ExperimentalPoemMaker requires the use of my fork of Datamuse4J, also found in my profile.
